I've hosted Desica's iDesign podcast, and am founder of [Desica](https://desica.uk). I even have my own themed version of bootstrap, [Desikit](https://npmjs.com/desikit).

## Loving my README? 😍

I used [metrics.lecoq.io](https://metrics.lecoq.io/), which I found out about from [@micahlt](https://github.com/micahlt). I made my badge in [Figma](https://figma.com/), and, that's about it.
